A good readme file has a link to the live deployed project. It helps the reader understand what the project does,
what technologies have been used, what features you'd like to add.
And, it also gives credit for any code that's been taken from other places,
such as libraries that you might have imported, or code that you found on Stack Overflow.
Even code that fellow students have helped you with, it's good to credit it here.
It should also contain screenshots of your finished project and details about how you
tested and deployed the project, and also how someone could clone and deploy it for themselves.
I always advise students to be as honest and detailed as possible in your README.md file.
Explain what works, what you didn't have time to do, what functionality
you'd like to add in the future, and what bugs you found and squashed along the way.
If you want, you can even separate your tests into a TESTING.md file if you want to keep
things a bit easier to read. A detailed README MD file can really help the reader to get a feel
for your project and your vision as a developer. It's also essential for your milestone projects
